## Introduction

I am a literal cyber wizard, well versed in the arts of the arcane C programming language and other low-level as well as high-level programming languages. I am adept at reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and other forms of cyber warfare. My main focus and line of work is in the field of cyber security and its many branches, but I also dabble in other fields of computer science such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, API development, and esoteric firmware programming.
